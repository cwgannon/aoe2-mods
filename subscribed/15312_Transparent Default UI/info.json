{"Author":"ByTheHoser","CacheStatus":0,"Description":"This mod makes the default UI 50% transparent. The idea is to keep the original aesthetic while increasing awareness of what is actually on your screen. Drag-selecting or double-clicking will still select units and buildings even when they are hidden under your UI, so the idea with this mod is to help make it clear what you have selected while also just generally helping you see a bit more of the map. It doesn't modify any of the .json files so it should be compatible with mods that changes the positioning of UI elements, such as the various Centered Minimap mods etc. It also works with the Tech Tree UI Mods made by RichardNixon216, just be sure to place his mod above this one so it has higher priority :)","Title":"Transparent Default UI"}
