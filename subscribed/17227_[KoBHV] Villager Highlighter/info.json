{"Author":"Addy607623","CacheStatus":0,"Description":"This small mod changes the icons of the villagers. It highlights the villagers in the queue. So it is easier to see, if the towncenter is idle or producing. It is now also easier to tell whether a military unit or a villager has been selected. You like the mod? Then try out more [KoBHV]-mods! If you have any questions or suggestions do not hesitate to contact me. Discord: Addy#1350","Title":"[KoBHV] Villager Highlighter"}
