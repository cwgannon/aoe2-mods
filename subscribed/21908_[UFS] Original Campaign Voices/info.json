Search <strong>UnluckyForSome</strong> to find them all!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Restore the original campaigns to their former glory! Most of us agree that the re-recorded voiceovers for the Age of Kings &amp; Conquerors campaigns were lacking something...</p><p>This mod features every single bombastic voiceover from the original Age of Empires 2 campaigns from 1999, now working with the Definitive Edition versions!</p><p>Both in-game voiceovers, AND pre/post game narrations have been replaced for all of the original campaigns.</p><p><strong>This mod contains only the English language voices. Other languages released include:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="../../../36743/">ESPA&Ntilde;OL</a></li></ul><p>Note: Due to modding limitations, some pre/post game narrations may go out of sync with the subtitles on screen. Microsoft is working to allow modding of the campaign.json files, which will fix the issue. I will update this mod and correct this as soon as Microsoft allows me to in a future update. Come on Bill Gates!</p><p>Please restart your game for changes to take effect.</p>","Title":"21908_[UFS] Original Campaign Voices"}
